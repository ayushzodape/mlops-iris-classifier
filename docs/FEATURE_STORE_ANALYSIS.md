Verification & Execution Steps
    • feast apply completes with no errors and reports 1 entity + 2 feature views created; data/registry.db file exists afterward.
    • feast materialize-incremental ... completes with a 100% progress bar for both feature views and no errors; data/online_store.db grows in file size.
    • Running get_online_features.py returns a dictionary with all requested feature keys populated (no None values) for sample_id 0, 1, and 2, confirming successful online retrieval.
    • Running get_historical_features.py produces a DataFrame with exactly 150 rows (matching the Experiment 4 dataset size) and all 6 requested feature columns populated with no unexpected nulls, confirming point-in-time offline retrieval.
    • feast feature-views list in the terminal lists both iris_measurements and iris_engineered_features with their respective entities and TTLs, confirming successful registration.
    • The clustering script (Step 8) runs to completion and prints non-trivial cluster counts (roughly reflecting the 3 known Iris species groupings), confirming the same registered features are consumable by a structurally different model.
